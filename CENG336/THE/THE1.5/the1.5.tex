First of all, I read the the1.5.pdf file.
I downloaded VM files which are provided us in Odtuclass.
I downloaded and installed MPLPABxIDE(v5.45) in VM.
Then, I needed to download PICSIMLab in VM.
I downloaded SimTest.hex file.
In order to debug that, I need to connect PICSIMLab to MPLabXIDE according to "PICSimLabGuide" file.
This was a problematic process for me.
Finally, after I connected these 2 programs properly, I start to debug in terms of steps in pdf.
Step 1,2,3,4 is easy for me , but in Step 5, openning Serial terminal is and using CuteCom part I have faced with some problems.
At the end, I completed the steps successfully.
 
Problems I have faced with :
- MPLAB saw picSimLab as installed but it did not work. Needed to delete and reinstall with the correct instructions.
- The picSimLab tab kept changing in the MPLAB configuration.
- The debug project button  does not work properly. I needed to use the debug section on the top of th program and need to make some changes.
