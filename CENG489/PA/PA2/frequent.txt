			BASTARD OPERATOR FROM HELL ##

IT'S BACKUP DAY TODAY SO I'M PISSED OFF.  BEING THE BOFH, HOWEVER, DOES HAVE
IT'S ADVANTAGES.  I ASSIGN THE TAPE DEVICE TO NULL - IT'S SO MUCH MORE
ECONOMICAL ON MY TIME AS I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GETTING UP TO CHANGE TAPES EVERY
# MINUTES.  AND IT SPEEDS UP BACKUPS TOO, SO IT CAN'T BE ALL BAD.

A USER RINGS

"DO YOU KNOW WHY THE SYSTEM IS SLOW?" THEY ASK

"IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH..."  I LOOK UP TODAY'S EXCUSE ".. CLOCK
SPEED"

"OH"  (NOT KNOWING WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE SATISFIED)  "DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT WILL BE FIXED?"

"FIXED?  THERE'S ### USERS ON YOUR MACHINE, AND ONE OF THEM IS YOU.  DON'T BE
SO SELFISH - LOGOUT NOW AND GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A CHANCE!"

"BUT MY RESEARCH RESULTS ARE DUE IN TOMMORROW AND ALL I NEED IS ONE PAGE OF
LASER PRINT.."

"SURE YOU DO.  WELL; YOU JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT BUDDY!"  I HANG UP.

SHEESH, YOU'D REALLY THINK PEOPLE WOULD LEARN NOT TO CALL!

THE PHONE RINGS.  IT'LL BE HIM AGAIN, I KNOW.  THAT ANNOYS ME.  I PUT ON A
GRUFF VOICE

"HELLO, SALARIES!"

"OH, I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT THE WRONG NUMBER"

"YEAH?  WELL WHAT'S YOUR NAME BUDDY?  DO YOU KNOW WASTED PHONE CALLS COST
MONEY?  DO YOU?  I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND TO SUBTRACT YOUR WASTED TIME, MY WASTED
TIME, AND THE COST OF THIS CALL FROM YOUR WEEKLY WAGES!  IN FACT I WILL!   BY
THE TIME I'VE FINISHED WITH YOU, YOU'LL OWE US MONEY!  WHAT'S YOUR NAME - AND
DON'T LIE, WE'VE GOT CALLER ID!"

I HEAR THE PHONE DROP AND THE SOUND OF RUNNING FEET - HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO
TRY AND GET AN ALIBI BY BEING AT THE DEAN'S OFFICE.  I LOOK UP HIS USERNAME
AND FIND HIS DEPARTMENT.  I RING THE DEAN'S SECRETARY.

"HELLO?" SHE ANSWERS

"HI, SIMON, B.O.F.H HERE, LISTEN, WHEN THAT GUY COMES RUNNING INTO YOUR OFFICE
IN ABOUT ## SECONDS, CAN YOU GIVE HIM A MESSAGE?"

"I THINK SO..." SHE SAYS

"TELL HIM `HE CAN RUN, BUT HE CAN'T HIDE'"

"UM. OK"

"AND DON'T FORGET NOW, I WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THAT FILE
IN YOUR ACCOUNT WITH YOUR ANSWERS TO THE PUURITY TEST IN IT..."

I HEAR HER SCRABBLING AT THE TERMINAL...

"DON'T BOTHER - I HAVE A COPY.  BE A GOOD GIRL AND PASS THE MESSAGE ON"

SHE SOBS HER ASSENT AND I HANG UP.  AND THE WORST THING IS, I WAS JUST GUESSING
ABOUT THE PURITY TEST THING.   I GRAB A QUICK COPY ANYWAY,  IT  MIGHT MAKE FOR
SOME GOOD LATE-NIGHT READING.

MEANTIME BACKUPS HAVE FINISHED IN RECORD TIME, #.## SECONDS.  MODERN TECHNOLOGY
IS WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?

ANOTHER USER RINGS.

"I NEED MORE SPACE" HE SAYS

"WELL, WHY DON'T YOU MOVE TO TEXAS?" I ASK

"NO, ON MY ACCOUNT, STUPID."

STUPID?!?....  UH-OH..

"I'M TERRIBLY SORRY" I SAY, IN A POLITE MANNER EQUAL TO THAT OF JIMMY STEWART
IN A FAMILY MATINEE "I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT.  WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU SAID?"

I SMELL THE FEAR COMING DOWN THE LINE AT ME, BUT IT'S TOO LATE, HE'S A GONER
AND HE KNOWS IT.

"UM, I SAID WHAT I WANTED WAS MORE SPACE ON MY ACCOUNT, *PLEASE*"

"SURE, HANG ON"

I HEAR HIM GASP HIS RELIEF EVEN THOUGH HE COVERED THE MOUTHPEICE.

"THERE, YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF SPACE NOW"

"HOW MUCH HAVE I GOT"

NOW THIS REALLY *PISSES* *ME* *OFF*!  NOT ONLY DO THEY WANT ME TO GIVE THEM
EXTRA DISK, THEY WANT TO CHECK IT, TO CORRECT ME IF I DON'T GIVE THEM ENOUGH.
THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH WHAT I GIVE THEM *AND THAT'S IT*!!!

BACK INTO JIMMY STEWART MODE.

"WELL, LET'S SEE, YOU HAVE # MEG AVAILABLE"

"WOW!  EIGHT MEG IN TOTAL, THANKS!" HE SAYS PLEASED WITH HIS BARGAINING POWER

"NO" I INTERRUPT, SAVOURING THIS LIKE A FINE RED, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE "# MEG IN
TOTAL..."

"HUH?...  I'D USED # MEG ALREADY, HOW COULD I HAVE # MEG AVAILABLE?"

I SAY NOTHING.  IT'LL COME TO HIM.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!"

I KILL ME; I REALLY DO!
